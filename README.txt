You can unzip to any directory. When unzipped, the source code is organized in
folders by chapter and design pattern. There is a separate folder for each
chapter.  In turn, each chapter folder contains example folders named after the
design patterns presented in the chapter.

Each example folder contains the following files:
 - example.html is the HTML document for the example.
 - page.css contains the CSS used in the example.
 - site.css contains trivial CSS that is common to all examples. 
 - ie6.css (when present) contains special CSS exclusively for Internet Explorer 6.
 - ie7.css (when present) contains special CSS exclusively for Internet Explorer 7.

The folder named JavaScript Library v0.24 contains the Source code and licenses 
for the JavaScript Libraries used in the book.
